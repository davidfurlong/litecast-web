## litecast-web

The web version of [Litecast](https://github.com/dylsteck/litecast), the mobile(iOS-first) Farcaster client that I've been building.

### Status of `litecast-web`
I'm much more focused on getting [Litecast mobile](https://github.com/dylsteck/litecast) to a v1 that I can get to more testers and then hopefully on the App Store(first iOS then Android) -- but I'd really like to have a web version as well! 

Right now `litecast-web` is read only and just shows a trending page, although I'll spend some time soon listing what it would take to get the web version to a 1.0.

### How to run locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to .env.local and add your Neynar keys from [dev.neynar.com](https://dev.neynar.com)
3. Run the app: `npm run dev`
